# Project Template

<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>This is a template designed for myself to be able to fully setup new projects very quickly. It contains a variety of dependencies to make developing a breeze, which I will list below. In the future, I will likely add a custom React template as well that will synergize nicely with create-react-app. This will do for now, however.</p>

1. Eslint with Airbnb style guide (VSCode plugin required)</br>
2. Prettier with Eslint plugin for compatibility with Airbnb style guide (VSCode plugin required)</br>
3. Tailwind
4. Webpack
5. Webpack dev server with hot reload enabled for changes to any src file,<br>
